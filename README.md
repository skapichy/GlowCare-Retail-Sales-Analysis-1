# GlowCare-Retail-Sales-Analysis-1
This project aims to evaluate GlowCare’s retail sales performance across organized stores in Lagos, Nigeria, from January 2023 to December 2025. The analysis supports data-driven commercial, operational, and strategic decisions by uncovering key insights into store performance, product profitability, customer behavior, and sales trends.

# 🧠 Business Insights
 The analysis delivers actionable insights across multiple dimensions:

## 1. Top-Performing Stores
Shoprite Ikeja City Mall, Shoprite Festival Mall, and Shoprite The Palms lead in total sales.
These stores also show high average order values (AOV), indicating strong customer spending per transaction.

2. Sales vs. Profitability

Despite high sales, stores like Jendol Ikorodu and Shoprite Adeniran Ogunsanya operate with lower profit margins (~29%), suggesting tight cost control or pricing strategies.

3. Product Performance

GlowCare Body Scrub, Face Cream, and Body Lotion are the most sold products by quantity.

GlowCare Body Scrub also tops profitability, followed by Face Cream and Facial Cleanser.

4. Category Revenue Drivers

Skin Care generates the highest revenue, followed by Body Care and Bath Care.

5. Location-Based Sales

Ikeja is the best-performing location with ₦27.39M in total sales.

Other strong locations include Festac, Lekki, and Alakuko.

6. Sales Trends Over Time

Monthly sales fluctuate with visible peaks and troughs.

Year-on-year growth shows a decline in 2024 (-7%) and recovery in 2025 (+6%).

7. Customer Payment Behavior

Payment methods are evenly distributed: Transfer (34.2%), POS (33.2%), and Cash (32.6%).

8. Discount Impact Analysis

Contrary to expectations, higher discounts correlate with lower average quantity sold, suggesting that discounts may not effectively boost volume.
